# JSON

## What is it?

JS - JavaScript<br>
O - Object<br>
N - Notation

JSON is a syntax for exchanging data between a browser and server. It is system agnostic, meaning it doesn't matter what code the server or browser is in.

Documentation for working with JSON in python is found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html)

## JSON syntax

Data is in name/value pairs:
```
"Name":"Value"
```

Curly Braces hold objects:
```
{"Name":"Value"}
```

Data can be separated by commas:
````
{"Name1":"Value1", "Name2":"Value2"}
````
Square brackets can be used for arrays:
````
{"Name":["Value1", "Value2"]}
````
