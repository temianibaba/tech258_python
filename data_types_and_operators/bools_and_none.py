# Bools and None

# What happens when you try to convert a string to a bool (using casting)?

# print(bool())
# Only 0 and nothing are boolean false
# None is a placeholder - best way to make a placeholder
# None as bool is false however None != false

x = None
print(x == False)
print(x == None)
print(type(x))
