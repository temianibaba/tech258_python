<br>Scripting is a way of providing instructions to a computer, so you can tell it what to do. Scripting is meant to aid 
programming, whereas coding for programs is to create complex software. It is mainly used to automate tasks. They provide 
control over one or more applications. 
### Interpreting vs Compling
**Interpreting** refers to code being translated and run line by line whereas **Compiling** refers to translating the entire code into
machine code and then being run.

## Standard packages in python
Here are some listed packages that are default with python. Overtime they were used so much it was considered installing 
python with these packages

1. Random
```python
import random
print(random.random())
print(random.randrange(1, 10))
```
This library allows you to create random numbers, after importing the library, the first print statement prints a number 
in between 0-1, and the second print statement prints a number from 0-10 not including 10
